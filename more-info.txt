Story (Quoted from Santa Claus): "As the year draws to a close, I have lots of gifts to give but I don’t have an optimal
arrangement to distribute them. Let’s try together not to leave empty under the Christmas tree as
much as possible. All I want for the new year, Cmpe students who make everything easier with
their algorithms."

• There are two kinds of regions, which we call the green region and the red region.
Therefore, trains and reindeers can be classified as those going to the green region and
the red region.

• Our gifts are in the bags, and we should distribute them to trains and reindeers
according to the properties of the bag. You can consider that the same type of gifts is in
the same bag, and we want to distribute them properly.

• Properties of bags are as follow, remark that one bag has more than one property:
  a. Each of the gifts in this bag type should be distributed through different vehicles,
i.e. there are no 2 gifts from the same bag on the same train or reindeer.
  b. Each of the gifts in this bag type should only be distributed to green regions.
  c. Each of the gifts in this bag type should only be distributed to red regions.
  d. Each of the gifts in this bag type should only be distributed by train.
  e. Each of the gifts in this bag type should only be distributed by reindeer.

• If it’s not specified, assume that gifts can be distributed to all regions, and both by train
and reindeer.

• Let’s look at some examples of bag types.
bd  | Can be distributed only by trains which go to green regions.
ace | Can be distributed only by reindeers which go to red regions and there are no 2 gifts from this bag on the same reindeer.
c   | Can be distributed only to red regions, both by trains and reindeers.
d   | Can be distributed only by trains, to both the red and the green regions.
a   | Only constraint is that there are no 2 gifts from this bag on the same vehicle.
bc  | Invalid, it won’t be given as an input to you because it is a contradictory.
de  | Invalid, it won’t be given as an input to you because it is a contradictory.

Input format (examine sample):
1                            | The number of trains that go to green region.
3                            | Capacity of each train.
2                            | The number of trains that go to red region.
1 9                          | Capacity of each train.
0                            | The number of reindeers that go to green region.
                             | If there is no such reindeer this line will be empty.
1                            | The number of reindeers that go to red region.
2                            | Capacity of each reindeers.
4                            | The number of gift types, i.e. number of bags.
ac 6 be 3 cd 4 ad 8          | Types of bags and numbers of gifts in them respectively.

Output format (examine sample):
12                           | The number of gifts that cannot be distributed. (Total amount of gift is 21, 9 is distributed.)
